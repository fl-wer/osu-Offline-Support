# Offline Support
Tool that displays scores from selected map, supports mod leaderboards, all game modes and has some extra features, should be used with 2 monitors and by offline players.

# Changing Pages
Go to next page **Shift+RightArrow**.
Go to previous page **Shift+LeftArrow**.

# Enabling Mod Leaderboard
You can enable mod leaderboard with **Shift+DownArrow**.  
Then simply change mod combination in **osu!**.

# ApiKey Security
Offline Support stores encrypted version of your osu! **api key**.  
I highly recommend changing encryption key and building project yourself.  
All new releases starting from v3 will have different **api key** from the source code.
