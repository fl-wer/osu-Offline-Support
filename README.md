# Offline Support
Tool that shows scores from selected map, supports mod leaderboards, all game modes and has some extra features, should be used with 2 monitors and by offline players.

# Changing Pages
Go to next page **Shift+RightArrow**.  
Go to previous page **Shift+LeftArrow**.

# Mod Leaderboard
You can enable mod leaderboard with **Shift+DownArrow**.  
Then simply change mod combination in **osu!**.

# Api Key Security
Offline Support stores encrypted version of osu! **api key** on your device.  
I highly recommend changing **encryption key** and building project yourself.  
All new releases starting from v3 will have different **encryption key** from the source code.
